1. Check if 'brew' is installed (by typing brew in terminal)
To install, command:
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" < /dev/null 2> /dev/null

2. Install MySQL
homebrew install mysql

(Start mysql as a service:) brew services start mysql
(if you want to end mysql, try:) brew services stop mysql

You have another option for controlling mysql server, which is:
mysql.server start
mysql.server stop

Either way will work, but you should only use 1 option.

3. You might need these extra steps to reset the root password for mysql server:
  mysqld --skip-grant-tables &
  mysql
  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
  SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('yourpassword');

4. Login to the MySQL console:
mysql -h localhost -u root -p


5. Rails website settings
After the above workflow, you will have your mysql server fully functional in your local.
Then add a new file 'password.yml' to your config folder with the following content:


defaults: &defaults
  mysql:
    username: root
    password: yourpassword


development:
  <<: *defaults


integration:
  <<: *defaults


production:
  <<: *defaults

6. Run:
rake db:reset
rails db:migrate
rails s

will work.

7. Also, if you want to get rid of mysql command line, you can choose a MySQL GUI (for example, Sequel Pro)
to help better alternative view of data.
